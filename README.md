# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Workspace

Welcome to your LeetCode learning journey with Antigravity! This workspace helps you organize and track your LeetCode solutions.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
leetcode-enjoyer/
├── easy/          # Easy difficulty problems
├── medium/        # Medium difficulty problems
├── hard/          # Hard difficulty problems
└── README.md      # This file
```

## 🎯 Workflow

### 1. **Solve Problems Here**

- Write and debug your solutions in this workspace
- Get full Antigravity support (autocomplete, debugging, refactoring)
- Test your code locally

### 2. **Submit to LeetCode**

- Copy your final solution from this workspace
- Paste it into LeetCode's online editor
- Submit and get your results tracked by LeetCode

### 3. **Track Your Progress**

- Keep all your solutions organized by difficulty
- Add comments and notes for future reference
- Use Git for version control (recommended)

## 📝 File Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive names for your solution files:

```
[number]-[problem-name].[ext]

Examples:
- 1-two-sum.js
- 15-3sum.py
- 206-reverse-linked-list.cpp
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Organization

- ✅ One file per problem
- ✅ Include problem description as comments at the top
- ✅ Add complexity analysis (time & space)
- ✅ Keep multiple approaches if you found better solutions

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand** - Read and comprehend the problem
2. **Plan** - Think about approach and edge cases
3. **Code** - Write solution with Antigravity's help
4. **Test** - Run test cases locally
5. **Optimize** - Improve time/space complexity if possible
6. **Submit** - Copy to LeetCode and submit

### Template Structure

```python
"""
[Problem Number]. [Problem Name]
Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/[problem-slug]/

Description:
[Brief problem description]

Example:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

Constraints:
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]
"""

def solution():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Time Complexity: O(?)
# Space Complexity: O(?)

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test case 1
    assert solution() == expected_output
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Keep a log of problems you've solved:

| #   | Problem | Difficulty | Date       | Status | Notes             |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1   | Two Sum | Easy       | 2025-12-30 | ✅     | Hash map approach |
